# Injecting a Watermark into a Video
With all the mathematics and understanding now. All we care is if this system works and i can say it works!

Below is attached a Jypyter Notebook of my experiment using Open-CV.

### Objective: Inject a watermark into a video

In this notebook i attempt to inject a transparent watermark into a
video. The watermark is a png image with transparent background. The
watermark is injected into the video by overlaying the watermark on the
video frame by frame. The watermark is overlayed on the video frame by
frame using the following steps:

1.  Read the video frame by frame
2.  Resize the watermark to the size of the video frame
3.  Overlay the watermark on the video frame
4.  Write the video frame to the output video buffer
5.  Repeat steps 1-4 for all the video frames
6.  Save the output video buffer to a file
7.  Display the output video with watermark transparently overlayed on
    the video
